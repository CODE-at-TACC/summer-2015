Raspberry Pi Robotics
=====================

#### Objectives
1. Assemble the BrickPi unit
2. Configure the Raspberry Pi
3. Test the BrickPi system
4. Build your first robot

You will work in teams of at least two (though you can add friends if you like). One team member's Raspberry Pi will act as the embedded brain for various robot inventions. The other Raspberry Pi will act as a control center for programming the one controlling the robots.

## Assemble the BrickPi unit


## Configure the Raspberry Pi

:star: Follow these steps on the both the Pi unit destined for use in the BrickPi as well as the system used to control it.

### Basic settings

Intro text

* Access **raspi-config** configuration GUI by running the command `sudo raspi-config`
* Under the **8 Advanced Options** set the following
  * SPI **Enable**
  * I2C **Enable**
  * Shell messages on a serial connection **Disable**

### Install the BrickPi software

```shell
cd /home/pi/summer-2015/robotics
sudo bash setup1.sh
```

* After this set of commands finishes running, the Pi will restart. When that finishes, open a new Terminal and enter the following commands

```shell
cd /home/pi/summer-2015/robotics
sudo bash setup2.sh
```

## Test the BrickPi system

1. Connect a LEGO Mindstorms motor to BrickPi Motor Port B
2. Open a Terminal window and run the following commands

```shell
cd /home/pi/summer-2015/robotics
python test1.py
```

The LEGO motor should begin spinning and run for 15 seconds. Then, it will reverse for another 15 seconds.

## Build your first robot

#### What you learned
* Assembling a BrickPi unit
* Installing the software dependencies for BrickPi
* Testing whether the assembled BrickPi works
* Building a Simple Robot with BrickPi
