Raspberry Pi Pulsemeter
=======================

## Objectives
1. [How can our finger tell us our pulse?](../intro/index.md)
2. [Starting with blinky lights... and testing](01_LEDs.md)
3. [The analog-to-digital (A/D) converter](02_A2D_converter.md)
4. [Signal amplification](03_OpAmps.md)
5. **[Maker Success!](04_Data.md)**

## Do you have a pulse?

![Success!](images/success.jpg)

You just made a computer interact in a meaningful way with the outside world using GPIO pins and basic electronic components.  You gave your RasPi eyes and taught it how to interpret what it sees!!!  Probably time to tell Twitter or Mom (or both).  What else could you build?


## Some final challenges

* What is your resting heart rate?
* How high is it after you run?
* The peak detection algorithm is very simple (and changeable). How would you do it?
* Can you add a pushbutton to make your program start measuring pulses?
* What happens if you change the LED color?
