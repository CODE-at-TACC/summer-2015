# Introduction to Processing

![Processing logo](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Processing_Logo_Clipped.svg/200px-Processing_Logo_Clipped.svg.png) [Processing](https://processing.org/) is the open source language developed over the Java programming language to aid teaching computer programming through visual interactions. Today we will be learning the basics of processing to aid us in understanding distributed computing. First, you need to install processing on your Raspberry Pi 2.

# Installation

There is no official ARM version of processing available, but luckily it runs in java. Processing 2.2.1 (stable) requires Oracle Java 7, so we'll need to download and install that from the Raspbian repositories.

```shell
sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-jdk
```
Now that we have java, we can download and untar processing.

```shell
wget http://download.processing.org/processing-2.2.1-linux32.tgz
tar -xzf processing-2.2.1-linux32.tgz
```

The -xzf parameters tell tar to e(x)tract, un(z)ip, the (f)ile: processing-2.2.1-linux32.tgz. The gz in tgz denotes a gzipped tarball. Now, we just need to link in our new Java to make it functional.

```shell
cd processing-2.2.1
rm -rf java
ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/jdk-7-oracle-armhf java
```

The ln command makes a [symbolic link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) to our Oracle Java 7 without having to move or copy the installation. We can now test to make sure everything worked by launching Processing.

```shell
./processing
```
After some messages on your console, the graphical IDE pictured below should appear.

Next, we'll be learning the basics of processing and making our first program.
