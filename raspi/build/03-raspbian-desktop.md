# Explore the Raspbian desktop


#### The desktop

The graphical desktop is similar in many aspects to what you find with Windows of Mac.  The different icons and features are highlighted here.

In particular, the *Menu* allows access to almost all installed software with graphical interfaces, including *Programming*, *Accessories*, and *Preferences*. 

#### The web browser

The default web browser on the Raspberry Pi is called *Epiphany*.  It is similar in capability to other standard web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. The important buttons are labelled below.

#### The file browser

When looking around for files on your Raspberry Pi, you can use the *file browser*.  Like both Mac and Windows, you can see folders and files, double click folders to open them for viewing, and double click files to open the file in an appropriate program.

Opening the file browser is a convenient way to see how much space you have on your SD card.  We’ll talk more about the command-line path in a little while.

#### The terminal

Similar to the *file browser*, the *terminal* allows you to explore files and folders.  However, the terminal does not have a graphical interface.  This is an advantage when working with programs that also do not have a graphical interface.  We will learn more about using the terminal in a little while.

#### Text editor

You can create and edit text files using the *Text Editor* called Leafpad.  To access Leafpad, click the *Menu* icon and select *Accessories* and then select *Text Editor*.

Turning on *Line Numbers* can be helpful when working with computer code.  You can turn it on through the *Option* menu in Leafpad.

#### Turning off

Through the *Menu* you can access the *Shutdown* options.  Here you can elegantly power down the Raspberry pi, reboot, or simply logout.

#### Challenges

1. Use Leafpad to create a new file and save it to your Desktop
2. Open up this page in your web browser
3. Make a local copy of this website (called a *git repository*) onto your computer. First, open the terminal.  Then, copy the following line from your web browser and paste it into the terminal. Press *Enter*
```
git clone https://github.com/CODE-at-TACC/summer-2015.git
```


#### What you learned

1. How to access the web browser and go to a website.
2. How to use the file browser to explore the contents of your SD card.
3. How to open and save files.
2. Shut down, restart, or log out .
4. How to access the terminal.
5. How to use `git clone`.
